FYS-4155
Project by James Claxton, Lukas Materne and Lasse Steinnes

The repository is a Machine Learning algorithm, specifically running Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge and LASSO regression.

The 'main_project1.py' file is when the script is run from'

'additional_functions' contains extra function and most importantly the benchmark function for looping through instances of the model class

'2DPolyFit.py' is a class which contains all the functions for creating a Machine Learning model

'plotting.py' is a file for plotting the output data in various ways
